			<dt>Gameplay</dt>
			<dd>Overwatch is a team-based game. The 5-player teams work to defend a payload, secure an objective, or push a robot. Players choose a unique character to compete against the opponents (who also choose unique charaters).</dd>
			<dt>Diversity</dt>
			<dd>Overwatch has three different type of charaters - Support, Damage, and Tank. Each type does as it is named. Each character is diverse and no two characters have the same ability.</dd>
			
			<dt>Support</dt>
			<dd>Support characters support and heal their teammates. Because of their low suvivability, they generally stay in the back lines.</dd>
			
			<dt>Damage</dt>
			<dd>Damage characters deal damage to the opponentes. Damage is the most diverse catagory. Their roll is to disrupt the enemy lines in order to win.</dd>
			
			<dt>Tank</dt>
			<dd>Tank characters take damage and make space. The tank is supposed to take to make sure that his team does not die. They should pressure the other team to make mistakes.</dd>
